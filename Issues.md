# Project Issues and Solutions

## 1. GitHub Pages Configuration
- Ensure repository settings have GitHub Pages enabled
- Set GitHub Pages to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch
- Verify the custom domain settings if you're using one

## 2. Build Configuration Issues
- The project is using `@sveltejs/adapter-static` which is correct for GitHub Pages
- Base path is set to `/tenseisurf` in `svelte.config.js` which is correct
- Make sure repository name matches the base path in `svelte.config.js`

## 3. Dependencies and Versions
Current issues:
- Using Svelte 5 (beta) which might cause stability issues
- Some dependencies might need updates
